"moduleDescription": "Sense-making is the process of creating situational awareness and understanding in situations of high complexity or uncertainty in order to make decisions. Strategic data analytics based solutions can be roughly modelled at three levels: sensing, sense-making and decision making. This module focuses on sense-making which is the ability to describe, diagnose and resolve problem situations in a multi-sensor (up to thousands of sensors) environment. It complements existing MTech KE courses by developing practical know-how in data processing, data analysis, event processing, data visualization and insights discovery techniques.",
