"moduleDescription": "Luxury products such as spices were among the first to encompass the Old World, from Indonesia to Europe. European colonization of the New World brought seemingly frivolous commodities such as sugar into play that provided the motive for New World slavery. In the modern world, basic foodstuffs such as wheat or vegetables have taken over as developed countries have outsourced much of their food supply. The course will look at continuities and changes in global exchanges including cultural as well as economic implications.",
