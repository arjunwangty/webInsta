"moduleDescription": "The Anthropocene is the proposed term meant to designate a new epoch in Earth\u2019s geological history in which we, the anthropos, have become a geological force. From rising sea levels, spiking temperature, to mass extinctions, humanity has not simply changed the biogeochemical profile of the Earth but done so to the point of threatening its very survival. In its altered state, the Earth appears increasingly unable to sustain the agricultural, energy, and capital networks that humanity has built to drive itself. The Anthropocene, in other words, figures man as a primary agent of a grand planetary drama at the same time it stymies his ability to act. This module examines the notion of agency in the conditions of the Anthropocene. It asks what a warming, liquefying, dying world might reveal about the realities and limits of our agency?",
