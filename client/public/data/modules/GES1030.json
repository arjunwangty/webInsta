"moduleDescription": "For 700 years Singapore has been a key node on world maritime trade routes. The study of maritime culture in Singapore requires integration of data from numerous disciplines including archaeology, history, economics, engineering, and ecology, to name some of the most significant. The prosperity of Singapore depends to a major extent on its port, yet few students are aware of the importance of maritime industry to the formation of the country. This module will explore Singapore\u2019s appearance as a trading port in the 14th century, the reasons for its growth, and the sea\u2019s influence on Singaporean society and economy.",
