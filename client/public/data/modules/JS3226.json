"moduleDescription": "This module explores the fascinating relationship between humans and environment in Japan. We will use Japan to think about how we humans should interact with and treat the precious environment that sustains us. We will consider the topic from a variety of disciplinary perspectives including myths, literature and thought, popular culture, architecture and art, politics, economy, law, environmentalism, and social movements. The module will be of value to any students who have an interest in the environment, Japan, or both. Students will leave the module not only with knowledge about Japan, but hopefully, greater sensitivity to the challenges facing humankind today.",
