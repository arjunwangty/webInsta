"moduleDescription": "This module allows the students make connection between their theory learning and clinical practicum. The students will apply the skills of history taking, physical examination, and clinical decision into the clinical practice, therefore exercise their ability to formulate appropriate clinical diagnoses, order and interpret common investigations with rationale, as well as work collaboratively with other healthcare professionals to develop plan of care based on the evidence based practice. The clinical practicum will reinforce the clinical and professional competencies as required by Singapore Nursing Board (SNB).",
