"moduleDescription": "This module critiques the effects of advertising. Specifically, it deconstructs the role of advertising as practiced by commercial, non-commercial and a variety of other entities to persuade us to adopt products, services, ideas, and ideologies. In doing so, we highlight negative and positive advertising effects from communicative, psychological, cultural, sociological, and political perspectives. Various social and ethical implications of advertising on society in general, and on various vulnerable populations, such as children, minorities, and women, in particular are also discussed. The module promotes approaches to manage advertising influences through active citizen participation to achieve a more enlightened society.",
