"moduleDescription": "This course provides an intensive introduction to key topics in post-colonial theory through an overview of representative literary and theoretical texts. The syllabus demonstrates the vexed significance of the \u201cpost\u201d in post-colonial cultural traditions. In tracing how decolonization remains bound up with older, colonial forms of knowledge/power, we approach post-coloniality as an aftermath. Through a range of writerly forms and cultural media, we identify the post-colonial in the question of \u201ctradition\u201d and its centrality to \u201cnon-Western\u201d modernity; in inscriptions of race/ethnicity/sexuality into Third World humanism; as the mourning for a vanishing past; as aesthetic resistance to homogenizing processes of modernization.",
