"moduleDescription": "This special topics honours seminar will explore the major holistic, traditional, and complementary medicines that originated in Asia and are widely used in Singapore. Holistic health practices are global industries and in the biological and social sciences. In this course, students will study holistic health from a social construction of health perspective in order to examine how people understand, legitimate, and promote these \u201calternative\u201d or \u201ctraditional\u201d medicines. Despite the regional affiliation of health practices such as Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, and yoga with particular Asian countries, these health practices are more accurately understood as transnational productions.",
