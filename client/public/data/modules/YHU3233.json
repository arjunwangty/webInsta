"moduleDescription": "There has been a recent surge of interest in the political philosophy of Benedict-de-Spinoza. He has been hailed variously as the originator of an enlightenment more radical than that of the philosophes or as a conservative thinker; as an early champion of liberalism, or as a proto-Marxist materialist; as an atheist hostile to religion or as a defender of religious forms; as an arch-rationalist, or a champion of the imagination. In this course, students will read the original texts on their own terms; on this foundation, students will be able to navigate the contemporary debates over those texts' significance.",
