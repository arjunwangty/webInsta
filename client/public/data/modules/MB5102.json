"moduleDescription": "To provide a working understanding of basic cell functions with the physical and chemical principles underlying them. In practical terms, we will attempt to understand a number of important problems relevant to mechanoregulation of cellular function. The assignments will primarily involve reading original literatures under the guidance of MBI investigators to complete a few entries into the Manual for Cellular and Molecular Functions.",
