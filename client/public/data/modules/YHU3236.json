"moduleDescription": "This course examines \u2018body\u2019 or performance art, a form of visual art practice that emerged from the experimental art of the 1960s. Performance art, often involving the live, nude body of the artist and tactics of shock, confrontation, and extreme audience participation, remains an important approach today. Performance art interrogates our assumptions about gender and race; the relation of body to \u2018self\u2019; the vulnerability of the individual and the nature of the social contract; our roles in family, community, and nation; and asserts the necessity to \u2018speak truth to power\u2019. This course involves graphic images (nudity and sexual references).",
