"moduleDescription": "The module prepares students to understand and work with middle-aged and older people through a combined lifespan developmental approach and ecological perspective. The focus is on the intergenerational issues. Emphasis is also placed on theoretical frameworks related to the ageing process and specific ageing issues such as dementia, and widowhood. Students will be given opportunities to improve their communication and relationship skills through role play in discussion groups and a case study which they conduct as part of their written term assignment.",
