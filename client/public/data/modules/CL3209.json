"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students to the various mechanisms behind how the Chinese language is acquired. Differences as well as similarities in the acquisition process by learners of Chinese as a first and second language are examined. Students will gain an insightful glimpse at learning Chinese as a first language or (to a lesser extent) second language, along with their associated linguistic, developmental and socio-cultural issues. There is a significant practical orientation to this module which include collecting real-life linguistic data (through recordings etc.), transcribing the data and analysing them.",
