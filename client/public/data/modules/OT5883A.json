"moduleDescription": "This subject will provide basic as well as advanced concepts in the area of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). It will deliver the concepts of microscopic and macroscopic displacement of fluids in a reservoir, displacement efficiencies, mobility control processes, chemical EOR, miscible processes, thermal recovery processes, and novel EOR methods (e.g. low-salinity waterflooding, nano-EOR).",
