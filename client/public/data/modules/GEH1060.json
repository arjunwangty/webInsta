Various expressions of ideologies from differing periods eventually revolutionized and efffectuated the versatility of the piano, shaping a legacy which led to the \u201cglobalization\u201d of the piano, including China. Students will learn through lectures, readings, discussions, listening, playing, and attending piano recitals and masterclasses.",
