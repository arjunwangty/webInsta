"moduleDescription": "Starting by examining the theory and the need for choice of law and jurisdiction clauses, this course will examine various issues with these clauses by involving students in drafting, negotiating, concluding and eventually enforcing choice of law and jurisdiction clauses (in particular arbitration clauses) in international commercial contracts in Asia. This will be done through real life scenarios being introduced into the classroom in which students will act as lawyers advising and representing clients in drafting and negotiating choice of law and jurisdiction clauses as well as attacking or defending them before a tribunal in a dispute context. Accordingly, students will live through the life of various choice of law and jurisdiction clauses and see how they can be drafted, negotiated and enforced in Asian jurisdictions. Upon completion of the course, students will have learnt the theories behind choice of law and jurisdiction clauses as well as the practical skills and lessons in negotiating, finalizing and enforcing them.",
