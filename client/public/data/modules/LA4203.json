"moduleDescription": "Human inhabitation and intervention on the landscape is traced from prehistoric times to the present. In particular, the relationship between humans and landscape as presented in particular traditions and cultures is highlighted. The coverage is broad, including both Eastern and Western traditions and ancient and modern practices. Emphasis is on comparative studies between different cultures and traditions rather than on detail and depth of any particular practice of landscape intervention.",
