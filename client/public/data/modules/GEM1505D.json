"moduleDescription": "Students are given a hands-on introduction to bioengineering design and an understanding of how biomimetic principles can be used to address engineering problems. Students will discover how nature/biology may be mimicked to provide solutions to bioengineering problems. The course will have a large practical component as students are presented with a bioengineering design problem and subsequently produce a solution incorporating biomimetic concepts. Novel solutions will be encouraged as students are exposed to the design process from the concept stage through to the fabrication of a prototype. Students will work in small groups on their design project. The final grade will be based on 100% continuous assessment involving assignments, laboratory work and projects.",
