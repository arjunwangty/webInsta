"moduleDescription": "This course surveys the financial methods used in mergers and acquisitions, buyouts and corporate restructurings. We will examine the process of evaluating opportunities in the corporate-control market; analyse how deal structure affects both value creation and value division; investigate M&A motivations and tactics; consider M&A valuation of stand-alone firms, merged firm synergies, transaction contingent clauses and the expected impact on share value and earnings accretion/dilution; and assess the valuation and structuring of leveraged buyouts and the recapitalization and restructuring of troubled firms. Major M&A constituents, such as private equity and hedge fund groups are also considered.",
