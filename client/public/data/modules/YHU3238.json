"moduleDescription": "Starting with the Spanish invasion of Aztec Mexico and ending with the Haitian Revolution in 1791, this course explores a transformative period in history. The accidental discovery of America initiated several centuries of intensive economic, military and religious activities throughout the Atlantic world. These transformations had catastrophic consequences for indigenous peoples and relied upon the labour of twelve million enslaved Africans. This course compares English, Spanish, Dutch, and French practices of colonialism and traces the development of racialized categories of difference while also considering how indigenous people, enslaved Africans, and \u201crogue\u201d colonists resisted slavery, servitude, and imperial authority.",
