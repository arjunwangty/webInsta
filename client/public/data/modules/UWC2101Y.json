"moduleDescription": "This module teaches writing and critical thinking by introducing students to the assumptions that inform, and the arguments for, different concepts and practices of justice. Students will engage topics such as human rights, the place and limits of legal institutions, justifications for civil disobedience, and whether violence is justified in the pursuit of justice. This module enables students to think critically about theories of justice and how these theories shape the pursuit of justice in political life.",
