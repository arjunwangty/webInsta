"moduleDescription": "This module covers the aspects of radiation physics necessary for understanding modern radiation therapy. Topics include the physics of radiation producing equipment in oncology (e.g. linear accelerators); photon and electron beams; ionization chambers and calibration protocols; quality assurance and commissioning; methods of modeling and implementing radiation therapy; advanced treatment planning and delivery. The clinical and patient safety considerations will be emphasized.",
