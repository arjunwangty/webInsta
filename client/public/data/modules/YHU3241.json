"moduleDescription": "This course provides in-depth exploration of SEAsian court performance genres, in particular Khmer and Javanese, as they have been appropriated, reconstructed, repurposed, reimagined, abused, abandoned, and recovered from 1945-1998. Through exploration of primary sources \u2013 including translated epics, histories, ethnographic descriptions and analyses, and performance itself \u2013 the course will first trace the ways in which arts have been used to demonstrate/confirm courts as rightful centres of power and potency over time and then use these themes as tools for interpreting the political uses of performance in Khmer and Javanese contexts in the second half of the twentieth century.",
