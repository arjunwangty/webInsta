"moduleDescription": "This course provides academic credit of major research projects conducted by students prior to the Capstone project. The scope and depth of the research should be at the level of a Capstone project, and thus requires unusually strong preparation in science. All projects must be approved by the Director of the Science Division before the course is selected.",
