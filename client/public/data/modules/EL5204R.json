"moduleDescription": "Typology and universals are concerned with how the pieces of languages are put together, what they contain, and how and why they interact and function as they do. Students acquire a broad overview of the grammatical make-up of languages and an understanding of an important approach in contemporary linguistics. Typology contributes to and draws on core areas of linguistics that students have studied.",
