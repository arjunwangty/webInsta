"moduleDescription": "This module examines the physiological, psychological, socio-cultural contexts of ageing and the attendant implications for individuals, families, and societies. Macro issues such as the impact of longer life expectancy, a greying workforce, and 'feminization of ageing' would be brainstormed in a seminar style of teaching. Social policies, social interventions and the impact of economic and social contexts on the well being of older people would increase the students' awareness and understanding of gerontological issues. Through interactive teaching, the students will learn about the theories of ageing and social policy issues such as income security, health care, housing, and leisure activities.",
