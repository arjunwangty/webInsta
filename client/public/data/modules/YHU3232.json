"moduleDescription": "The course will examine the production, reception and interpretation of the female imagery and representation of gender roles for Japanese women through visual images and literary texts from the 11th to the 20th century, with an emphasis towards the modern period. The female image occupies a crucial part in understanding key historical and cultural developments in Japan, such as how the evolving influences of Westernization and modernity began to characterize Japanese society during the early decades of the 20th century. Students will analyse a wide range of materials from 11th century novel to literary pieces by renowned modern authors.",
