"moduleDescription": "This module aims to develop a strong knowledge base on the different building materials and technique of designing structural frames with some of these materials. As a whole, this module focuses on key building materials that are applied to the envelope and structural systems of buildings. For the envelope system, coatings made from advanced nanotechnology and phase change materials will be taught. Conventional yet important structural materials such as wood, steel, wood and masonry will be covered next, leading to the discussion on various types of structural systems and their designs. Finally, life cycle assessment will be introduced as a basis for evaluating and selecting environmentally superior materials.",
