"moduleDescription": "The law governing the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts is absolutely central in public international law and cuts across various sub-fields of that discipline. This seminar investigates the fundamental tenets of the law of State responsibility, both from theoretical and practical standpoints, while tracing some of its historical roots. More broadly, the seminar will provide an overview of different doctrines of State responsibility and different theories and approaches to liability under international law. More importantly, the later sessions of the seminar will engage critically with the role that the law of State responsibility can play in specific areas.",
