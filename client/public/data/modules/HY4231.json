"moduleDescription": "People today tend to see the family and the state as two separate spheres with clear boundaries \u2014 private sphere and public sphere. In Chinese tradition, the family and the state are, however, inherently connected. Arranged on a chronological and thematic basis, this module provides students an opportunity to survey the development of family-state relations in Chinese history from the ancient to the modern eras. It examines how different teachings\u2014such as Confucianism and Buddhism\u2014significantly defined family-state relations and how the popular culture \u2014 such as dramas and novels \u2014 represented and reshaped these relations over time.",
