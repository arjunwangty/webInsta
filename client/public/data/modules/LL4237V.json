"moduleDescription": "This module aims to explore the interaction between legal institutions and economic/business development in Greater China (i.e. China, Taiwan, HK), with focus on China. How has China been able to offset institutional weaknesses at home while achieving impressive economic results worldwide? Have China\u2019s experiences indicated an unorthodox model as captured in the term \u201cBeijing Consensus\u201d? To what extent is this model different from East Asian models and conventional thinking in economic growth? This course reviews theories about market development in the context of Greater China, including securities, corporate regulations, capital markets, property, sovereign wealth funds, foreign investment, and anticorruption etc.",
