"moduleDescription": "This module aims at providing students with essential information on the changing characteristics of Chinese communities in various parts of the globe and their evolving ties with China in the contemporary era. It covers topics and issues such as theory and methodology, patterns of migration, multiple identities, the emergence of new migrants, the formation of transnational business networks and the impact of political and economic developments in China on the Chinese overseas and vice versa. These thematic issues will be discussed in conjunction with specific cases drawn from selected countries (e.g. Japan, Australia and Singapore) or regions (e.g. North America and Europe).",
