Thematic foci include contemporary views of gender, especially the ideologies of \u201cseparate spheres\u201d and \u201cthe angel in the house\u201d; colonialism and industrialization; social class; and religious agitation and religious doubt. The class will also read and evaluate a few important critical articles concerning the women\u2019s tradition in the English novel.",
