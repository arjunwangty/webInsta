"moduleDescription": "This module is intended to enable students to pursue in-depth readings on a particular topic of interest to them which is relevant to the mission of the Southeast Asian Studies Programme but is not covered in the normal curriculum. It enables students to devise their own means of delving into an inquiry on a particular highly-specialized topic. The onus is on the student to compose a detailed list of readings on a topic which they themselves define, and to find a lecturer willing to supervise the student in completing and absorbing the reading material. The mode of assessment for this module is project work and examinations.",
