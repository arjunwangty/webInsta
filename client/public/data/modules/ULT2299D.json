"moduleDescription": "Whereas the goal of many literacy studies is to determine who is literate or what counts as literacy, the goal of this module is to examine the political, economic, and social assumptions, factors, and effects of the distinction between literacy and illiteracy. Although such a study could take place within any national context, this module will focus on Singapore as a location for taking up this issue. Organized around the literacy narratives and histories of USP students older generations of Singaporeans, and people from other cultures and nations, this module explores the impact of the distinction between those who are literate and those who are not on Singaporean identity, history, politics, and ethics.",
