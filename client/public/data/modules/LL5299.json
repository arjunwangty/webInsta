"moduleDescription": "This intensive course is designed for students and practitioners already acquainted with the fundamentals of international arbitration, and may be particularly useful for those who may have an inclination to specialize in the practice or study of international dispute resolution. Focus will be placed on topics of practical and academic interest in all aspects of the international arbitration process, looking in particular to recent trends and evolutions in the field of international dispute settlement. Through seminar discussions, student presentations and moot court sessions, this course will expose students to contemporary controversies in the field of international commercial and investment arbitration. An international approach will be adopted in relation to the subjects considered: students can expect to review a substantial amount of comparative law sources, including academic commentaries and jurisprudence from France, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as public international law sources and international arbitral practice.",
