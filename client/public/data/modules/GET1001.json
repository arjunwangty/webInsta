To do this we will combine diverse modes of learning, covering issues of knowledge and content (the history of cartography), practical skills of map making/reading, and critical skills of evaluating and interpreting maps. We will stimulate a critical awareness of mapping as an evolving technology that has far-reaching social and political considerations.",
