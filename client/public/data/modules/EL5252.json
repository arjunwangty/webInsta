"moduleDescription": "The study of variation and change in language employs quantitative statistical methods to account for phenomena in real-world language data. This module familiarises students with the major questions and methodologies of variationist research in sociolinguistics and corpus linguistics. Students will learn about the stylistic, social, and linguistic factors that influence how language is produced and perceived, and explore how data drawn from speech, texts, social media, and experimental methods are used to investigate variation. This module will prepare students to pursue independent research incorporating quantitative methods.",
