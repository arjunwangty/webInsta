"moduleDescription": "How do we understand culture, power and society in Southeast Asia? This module introduces students to debates on culture and power in Southeast Asia with the aim of inculcating comparative and critical reflections on cultural formations in the region. Both classical and contemporary studies of Southeast Asian cultures will be examined in order to better identify central issues around Southeast Asian cultural transformations as well as newer theoretical understandings on the relationship between power, culture, and history.",
