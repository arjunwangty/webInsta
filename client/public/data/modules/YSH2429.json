"moduleDescription": "Viruses are the tiniest but most numerous inhabitants of Earth. Although viruses notoriously cause deadly epidemics, not all viruses are bad and many are beneficial to their hosts and vital for ecosystem health. This course explores the \u2018good, bad and ugly\u2019 effects of viruses on biological systems. We examine how viruses invade host genomes, thwart host defenses, stymie conservation efforts, and change human history through deadly epidemics. But we also explore virus benefits, especially in biotechnology: biocontrol of pests, anti-cancer treatments, and therapies targeting other pathogens. Viruses dominate the planet, affecting our lives for better and for worse.",
