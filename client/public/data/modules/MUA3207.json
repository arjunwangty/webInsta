"moduleDescription": "The module aims to give students an opportunity to compose and perform their own music by introducing relevant techniques and concepts of composition, including ways of working with pitch, musical process, nontraditional notation, scaling, and layering. Class meetings will be workshop based, allowing students to get hands-on experience with the techniques and concepts introduced. In addition, students create a composition for a workshop wherein participants of varying musical abilities make music together.",
