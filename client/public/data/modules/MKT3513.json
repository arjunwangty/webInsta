"moduleDescription": "This course is an introduction to game theory and its applications in the realm of business. It aims to provide an overview of non-cooperative and cooperative games through the analysis of strategic interactions in conflict situations such as bargaining, market competition, monetary policy, auction, international trade, to name a few. Recurring themes include threatening and bluffing, punishing and rewarding, building reputations, and sustaining cooperation in non-cooperative environments through repeated interactions. More advanced topics on games with incomplete information such as moral hazard and incentives theory, mechanism design and the Revelation Principle will also be covered.",
