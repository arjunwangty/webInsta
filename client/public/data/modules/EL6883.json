"moduleDescription": "The modules focuses on the sociolinguistic aspects of English in multilingual societies as found in Southeast Asia, Europe and America. Issues related to the study of English in these societies will be raised. Chief among these are the spread, impact, distribution, characteristics, and overall dominance of English in the world. Questions to be discussed include the similarities and differences between American, European and Southeast Asian multilingual societies; the opportunities and limitations in multilingual societies using the language, given the globalisation of English; and whether English will function as a lingua franca for the world.",
