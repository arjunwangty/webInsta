"moduleDescription": "Aristotle is one of the two most important ancient Greek philosophers. This module complements the level 2000 module, PH 2222 Greek Philosophy (Socrates and Plato), and adds to the preparation for the Honours seminar on Greek Thinkers. Readings will be selected from various works representing the wide range of Aristotle\u2019s philosophical interests and achievements. In-depth exploration of a specific area (e.g. metaphysics, or ethics) or topic (e.g. theory of the soul or practical wisdom) will focus on one or two key texts. The module may include later Hellenistic philosophy (e.g. Epicureanism, stoicism, or scepticism) or contemporary development of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy.",
