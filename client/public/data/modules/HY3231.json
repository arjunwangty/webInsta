"moduleDescription": "This module focuses on the histories of the Malays who have populated the Straits of Melaka and the South China Sea. Discussions and lectures do not focus on chronology or a simple narration of &quot;facts,&quot; but upon a critical examination of questions such as &quot;who is Malay?&quot; and &quot;what is the Malay World?&quot;, allowing for a better understanding of the key social, cultural, political, and economic practices and institutions that have shaped the Malay experience. The module will be of interest to any student who wants to know more about Malays and the societies in and around Singapore.",
