Personal histories, professional rivalries, contemporary texts, visual images, political circumstances, intellectual trends, the publishing market \u2013 shape and influence the production of plays, poems, novels. This module will examine the literary history of one small segment of the eighteenth century in order both to understand texts in their context, and to develop skills of literary historical research. The five years under consideration might vary with different iterations of the module, but the foci will remain the same. The module will always concentrate on two general topics, and on two or three major works.",
