"moduleDescription": "This module focuses on languages evolving in multilingual settings out of radical contact situations. Commonly referred to as \u201cPidgins\u201d, \u201cCreoles\u201d and \u201cmixed languages\u201d, these languages are spoken mainly in the Caribbean and Asia-Pacific regions. We concentrate on English-lexified contact varieties and investigate the interaction of typological features and sociolinguistic factors determining language change in contact situations. We also discuss the most salient issues within the field of Language Contact such as: (i) Creoles as a synchronically viable structural class; (ii) restructuring patterns, creolisation and universal patterns of language change; (iii) pidgnisation; (iv) ideology and classification.",
