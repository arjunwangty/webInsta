"moduleDescription": "Increasing volumes of data are being collected across many fields, but often their complexity and size makes it challenging to transform data into information. Increasing computing power, married with advances in statistical methodology to harness such power, have provided a means to make sense of such big data. This course covers various computational statistical approaches such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or lasso, illustrated via copious real world examples.",
