"moduleDescription": "This course deals with active design of building systems for good IEQ and energy performance. It includes the conventional heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems typical of most existing buildings as well as emerging technologies such as district cooling/heating systems, cogeneration/tri-generation systems and energyefficient air-conditioning and air distribution systems. The Renewable Energy domain includes photo-voltaics, solarthermal, geothermal, wind and fuel cells.",
