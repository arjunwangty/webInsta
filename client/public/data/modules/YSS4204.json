"moduleDescription": "Colonialism was far from a singular experience. Trading posts like Singapore differed vastly in their colonial experience compared to settler colonies like the United States or plantation colonies like Jamaica. The varieties of colonial experience have led to differences in income, political institutions and cultural traits like interpersonal trust that persist even today. By the end of the course, students will have a better understanding of how colonialism affected and continues to affect political, economic and social outcomes.",
