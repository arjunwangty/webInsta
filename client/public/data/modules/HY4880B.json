"moduleDescription": "Students have been a potent force for social and political change in many parts of Asia, particularly since 1950. Arranged on a chronological and thematic basis, this module will give students an opportunity to survey the history of student activism, primarily but not exclusively, in Asian countries during this period. In emphasizing a comparative approach, the course not only looks into the causes, functions, effects, and limits of student movements in each society, but also explores intra-Asian, or even global, interconnections of student activism in the second half of the twentieth century.",
