"moduleDescription": "This course examines the anatomy and physiology of humans and other animals in an evolutionary and comparative framework. Major themes include the integration among physiological systems to maintain homeostasis; understanding biological structures as statements of homology; suboptimal or pathological adaptive solutions as the product of phylogenetic constraints or physiological trade-offs; and human adaptive plasticity in diverse environments. This course should be of interest to students wanting to learn about human and animal biology, chronic and metabolic pathologies in contemporary urban societies, or students considering careers in medical, veterinary, or pharmaceutical science.",
