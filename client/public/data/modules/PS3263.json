"moduleDescription": "This module examines the politics of economic development and underdevelopment. Students are introduced to major political issues in developing countries and to political science frameworks for understanding those issues. Themes covered include state-building, the relationship between development and democracy, the state\u2019s role in industrialisation, development problems and development policy. Specific countries are used as cases to illustrate \u2013 and criticise \u2013 arguments about politics and development, but the focus in this module is on common themes rather than the political histories of particular nations.",
