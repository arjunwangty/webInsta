"moduleDescription": "The module is designed to provide a clear and logical introduction to the concepts and principles of mechanics and thermodynamics, with illustrations based on applications to the real world. Topics covered include motion in one dimension; curvilinear motion; circular motion; relative motion; Newton's laws; friction; work and energy; conservative forces, conservation of energy; linear momentum and conservation, collisions; rotational kinematics; moment of inertia and torque; rotational dynamics; conservation of angular momentum; gravitational force, field and potential energy; planetary motion; temperature and the zeroth law, temperature scales; thermal expansion of solids and liquids; heat and internal energy, specific heat capacities, enthalpy and latent heat, work for ideal gases, first law of thermodynamics; equipartition of energy, mean free path; entropy and the second law, heat engines; entropy changes for reversible and irreversible processes. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.",
