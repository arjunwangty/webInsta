"moduleDescription": "This module explores distinctive institutional arrangements in Asian capitalism(s). The module is composed of three parts. The first part reviews foundational studies in comparative capitalism and economic sociology. The second part covers institutional varieties of Asian capitalism such as developmental states, business groups, social networks, and value systems. The last part provides case studies of key capitalist economies in the region. Towards the end of the course, students will assess the relevance and the limitations of existing theories, which have been established based primarily on Western experiences, in explaining the unique characteristics and the internal diversity of capitalisms in Asia.",
