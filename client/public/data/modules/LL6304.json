"moduleDescription": "This module will explore the principal problems for the theory and practice of comparative constitutional law, generally and in the globalizing conditions of the early 21st century. In doing so, it will range widely over countries and constitutional systems and examine the challenges presented by differences in context and culture. The conclusions about methodology in the early classes will be tested in later ones by reference to a series of topical substantive issues in constitutional law in Asia and elsewhere, ranging from institutional design to rights protection.",
