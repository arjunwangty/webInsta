"moduleDescription": "The module is designed for M.A./Ph.D. students in the Department and is a close, cross-sectional study of the development of Chinese society and culture in its various aspects over a given historical time span. It focuses on how different dimensions of an evolving culture were shaped and tied together into an organic whole. Topics vary from year to year depending on the lecturer\u2019s interests. A good reading knowledge of classical Chinese and English is required for study of selected problems through seminar discussions, group presentations and project works.",
