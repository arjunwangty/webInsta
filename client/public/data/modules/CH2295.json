"moduleDescription": "China has a long history of commercial activities ranging from domestic to international trade. The complex relation between state, culture and society in the last millennium of imperial Chinese history provided the space for a vibrant and yet different (as compared to that of the modern world) commercial culture to flourish. This course aims to understand how the Chinese people conducted business activities in the peculiar setting of late imperial China and its impact on intellectual, literary, religious and material culture, as well as gender politics of that period.",
