"moduleDescription": "Woolf lived in an era of tremendous historical-mindedness in which artists, writers, and historians were deeply engaged with how the past should be represented. Students will explore Woolf\u2019s engagement in this debate through close analysis of her diaries, drafts, and published works as well as primary source materials (museum artifacts and contemporary newspapers) that help place her engagement in the social, cultural, and political issues of the early twentieth century. Was this engagement with the past at odds with a liberal belief in progress, or was the past, for Woolf, a causal entity to be interpreted for its historical difference?",
