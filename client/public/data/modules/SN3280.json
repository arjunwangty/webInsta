"moduleDescription": "Public services such as health, education, power, telecommunications, ports, airports, railways and roads are essential for human development and economic growth in India. The focus is on the role of the government and private companies in the provision of these services. Some sectors have moved from being public sector monopolies to accepting private sector participation. In other areas, the government, private companies, and non-governmental organizations, are partnering in the delivery of essential services to citizens. Competition from private companies has increased the efficiency of the government sector and contributed to India\u2019s economic growth. The public sector remains important for the provision of services to India\u2019s poorest citizens. Topics will include the politics and economics behind regulation of private and government companies in these sectors, and, the promotion of efficiency and service delivery to the poor.",
