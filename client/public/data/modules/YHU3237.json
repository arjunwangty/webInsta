"moduleDescription": "This course explores the literature, music, film and popular culture of the Cold War in East Asia-the \u201cpartitioning\u201d of China, Japan and Korea into mutually hostile and temporally de-synchronized \u201czones\u201d in the post-WWII era. How do aesthetic works engage this historical trauma and ideological rift? Beginning with the major historical and social scientific writings on the formation of \u201cEast Asia\u201d as a region, we will study the shifting relations between U.S. and East Asia through a comparison of two case studies: the creation of North Korea/South Korea and the division/unification debates of Taiwan/China.",
