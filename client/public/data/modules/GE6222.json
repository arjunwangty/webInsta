"moduleDescription": "Transnationalism studies draw attention to social processes and relations that simultaneously transgress borders while remaining in some ways anchored on territorially defined spaces. This module examines the theoretical foundations, historical perspectives, methodological premises and innovative developments of transnationalism studies through empirically grounded analyses of transnational phenomenon. Topics offered may include but are not limited to transnational migration, institutional governance, socio-political mobilisations, corporations, urbanism or popular culture and media. Comparative examples from Asia and beyond will be drawn upon to inform discussions.",
