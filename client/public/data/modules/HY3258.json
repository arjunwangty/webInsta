"moduleDescription": "This module is about the history of the Cold War in the global south in the second half of the twentieth century. While the Soviet-U.S. rivalry and the European Cold War did not escalate into large-scale conflict, developments elsewhere were marked by significant violence and destruction. This course seeks to reconcile, if that is possible, the perception of the history of the Cold War as a \u201clong peace\u201d with the turbulent lived experiences of peoples in the global south. Which, and whose, Cold War best defines the history of the twentieth century?",
