"moduleDescription": "This module introduces students to the conceptual study of texts by leading writers from South Asia from countries as diverse as Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The course will encourage students to study these texts a) as reflections of the varied and rich cultural heritages that have given rise to them. b)as reflective of issues such as conflicts of colonialism; the complications of modernisms, such as cosmopolitanism and diaspora; c) as exploring issues relating to globalisation and its effects on diverse cultures and peoples. The course will also, where relevant, explore issues relating to cultural, gendered, racialized identitities. Students will be exposed to a range of relevant theoretical perspectives, which will help them in the analysis of these texts.",
