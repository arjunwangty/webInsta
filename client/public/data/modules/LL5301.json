"moduleDescription": "The course provides a grounding in the international and theoretical background to the constitutional protection of social rights; the substantive approach taken by courts to various social rights, and the interaction between social rights in various claims to equality and protection on the part of vulnerable groups. The topics covered in the class are thus: (1) theoretical debates on the nature of social rights, and the theoretical underpinnings for their recognition qua rights; (2) international human rights law instruments recognising social rights, and international human rights understandings of such rights; (3) constitutional debates about the capacity and legitimacy of courts enforcing such rights, and particular debates over concepts such as (a) weak-versus strong-form review, and (b) notions of a \u2018minimum core\u2019 to social rights; and (4) the actual interpretation of enforcement of key social rights by courts, with a particular focus on the right to housing, health care, water, food and social welfare and social security (5) questions of gender, poverty and social rights (6) the rights of children in relation to social rights (7) the rights of non-citizens",
