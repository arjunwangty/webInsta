Among the topics we will cover include marketing models and implementation, market segmentation, pricing, market structure, market share, market entry/timing, and distribution channels. We will rely heavily on journal articles in discussing these topics. Students are expected to be fully prepared for all readings. A research proposal on a topic (to be approved by instructor) based on those covered in this seminar is due at the end of the semester.",
