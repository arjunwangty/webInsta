"moduleDescription": "This module aims to develop a reasonable level of fluency in reading such contemporary Japanese materials as academic writings, dialogues involving colloquial speech, and relatively sophisticated analyses of Japanese culture, society, current affairs and business affairs. Attention will also be given to developing accurate translation skills and to some of the subtler points of Japanese and English grammar. The module will also involve practice in using computers for Japanese word processing and for making use of the Japanese Internet.",
