"moduleDescription": "This module studies European Union business regulation and how this affects both the EU and other markets. It has three components. The first looks at the types of business regulation deployed. It will include legislative harmonisation, private standardisation, mutual recognition and regulatory agencies. The second looks at the regulation of key industrial and service sectors, such as food, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, energy chemicals or financial services. The third looks at how EU business regulation interacts with non EU markets, through studying its commercial policy, free trade agreements and extraterritorial jurisdiction.",
