"moduleDescription": "Natural hazards result in high losses in human life and welfare, property, resource productivity, and infrastructure. Often human activities interact with the landscape to exacerbate the probability of a potentially hazardous situation. The module will cover the prediction, prevention, mitigation, and response strategies for various hazards. Various types of natural hazards, including landslides, debris flows, volcanic hazards, earthquakes, fire, tsunami, typhoons, floods, tornadoes, and wildfire will be highlighted with respect to inherent forms and processes. Examples will be presented from various regions worldwide. Land management issues and effects will be emphasized, particularly within the context of the Pacific Rim.",
