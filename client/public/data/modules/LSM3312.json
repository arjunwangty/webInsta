"moduleDescription": "In addition to having a good academic record and technical foundation, students with good soft skills and some industrial attachment or internship experiences often stand a better chance when seeking for jobs. This module gives non-Applied Science students the opportunity to embark on internships during their undergraduate study. The module requires students to compete for position and perform a structured internship in a company/institution for 16-20 weeks during regular semester. Through regular meetings with the Academic Advisor and internship Supervisor, students explore how knowledge learnt in the curriculum can be transferred to perform technical assignments in an actual working environment.",
