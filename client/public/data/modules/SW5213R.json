"moduleDescription": "It is estimated that in any given society 3 - 10% of the population has some form of disability. This increases to 15% when the definition of disability includes people who are limited in activity due to chronic conditions. In Singapore a conservative estimate of persons with some form of disability may be anywhere from 120,000 to 400,000 individuals. This would include both a medical perspective as well as a socio-functional perspective which emphasizes the need to address economic, environmental and cultural barriers. This module will use a life span perspective to discuss the impact of disability on the individual and the family. It will also use a systemic, ecological perspective to discuss the management, intervention and delivery of social services to people with disabilities.",
