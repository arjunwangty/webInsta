"moduleDescription": "Rapidly changing political and economic factors are creating a number of different sets of problems and opportunities for the preservation and protection of cultural resources in Southeast Asia. In this module, students will compare the policies of different Southeast Asian countries as well as relevant neighbouring regions. The varying emphases placed on different components of the policy mix (museums, historic preservation, development and marketing) in different countries will be compared. Students will be required to devise suggested strategic plans for integrating heritage tourism into long-term preservation policies.",
