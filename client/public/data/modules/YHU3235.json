"moduleDescription": "Graphic novels are now an established and popular literary genre. How do they tell a story that is socially relevant, and even question the status quo? This course will examine the graphic novel as a hybrid visual and literary form reflecting its particular sociopolitical context and as a vehicle for social critique. Focusing on graphic novels and their film adaptations from the Middle East/North Africa, the US, and Southeast Asia, we will consider how this unique genre explores colonialism, occupation, the trauma of 20th century war, normalizing and repressive societal and/or familial expectations, urban anomie, and suburban desolation.",
